# Project Title
Create a professional README

## Description: 
As a bootcamp student, I want to become a full stack developer. I am exploring Node.js. Which has given me a better understanding of server-side JavaScript  programming. In this project I have learned to use (Fs) which is a node module. The use of Express to handle routes and manage requests and responses. The use of the Inquirer library  for Node.sj to prompt the user. 

Working in this project allowed me to improve my JavaScript skills, and getting a better grasp of the syntax and data structure. 


## User Story:
As a coding boot camp student. 
I want a README generator. So that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
